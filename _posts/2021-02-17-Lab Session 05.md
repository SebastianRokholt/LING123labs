#### Welcome to Lab Session 5! <br>

Make sure that you've completed and understood the exercises from
[Lab Session 04](https://sebastianrokholt.github.io/LING123labs/posts/Lab-Session-04/) before getting started with
the exercises below. Don't hesitate to let me know if there's anything you need help with. This includes other concepts
mentioned in the lecture which aren't explicitly a part of the exercises. <br>

Additionally, don't forget that you can
discuss the exercises with your fellow classmates on [MittUiB](https://mitt.uib.no/courses/27100/discussion_topics),
the UiB Studyfellowship [Discord server](https://discord.gg/sXgmWQ2G) (channel: #ling123) or right here in
ling123labs.com's [comments section](#post-extend-wrapper).


The **lecture notes** for lecture 5 can be found
[here](https://lingkurs.h.uib.no/webroot/index.php?page=scripting/palindromes&lang=en&course=ling123).
<br>

Before you get started on the exercises, I recommend that you skim through [this post]() on some terminology and
setting the shell environment for scripts.

---

### Exercise 1: Palindromes with Awk <br>
a) Apply the
[palindromes script](https://lingkurs.h.uib.no/webroot/index.php?page=scripting/palindromes&lang=en&course=ling123)
to a large word list in order to find as many palindrome words as possible in a language.
Many systems contain a dictionary file /usr/share/dict/words. Alternatively, you can download
[The Unix Dictionary](http://wiki.puzzlers.org/pub/wordlists/unixdict.txt).
<br>


b) The script selects all strict palindromes, but not phrase palindromes, such as *Anne var i Ravenna*.
Extend the script so that the punctuation, spaces and capitalization are ignored.
This could be done by making three columns:
1. the original string
2. the normalized string
3. the reversed normalized string. If fields 2 and 3 are equal, field 1 is returned.
   <br>

> Tip 1: The `paste` command can take three arguments, like this: `paste $1 $1 -`.
> If you pass this to awk, you'll have three fields (columns) to work with. <br>
> Tip 2: You can use the AWK function [`gsub`](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/String-Functions.html)
> to perform string substitutions in `awk`. <br>
> Tip 3: The output should look something like this.
> Don't worry about the formatting, as long as you get the same result.

_Desired output from exercise 1b_


c) Create a script that finds all words in a file that are reverse anagrams but not palindromes,
for instance, *rail* and *liar*.
<br>
<br>


### Exercise 2: Character to word ratio <br>
a) When counting the number of characters, we should count the characters in words only, excluding spaces and
punctuation. Modify the script in the
[lecture notes](https://lingkurs.h.uib.no/webroot/index.php?page=scripting/charwordratio&lang=en&course=ling123)
accordingly. One way to do this involves tokenizing the file.
<br>

b) Print more information. Give the number of words and characters.
<br>

c) Try a way to compute the ratio of words to sentences.
<br>
<br>


### Exercise 3: Character frequencies with Awk <br>
a) Try also `source encrypt.sh < chess.txt | source charfreq.sh | head`. This will give you a clue about which cipher
letter represents the most frequent characters.
<br>

b) Extend the script from the
[lecture notes](https://lingkurs.h.uib.no/webroot/index.php?page=scripting/charfreq&lang=en&course=ling123) by first
changing all uppercase to lowercase letters.
<br>
<br>


***- END OF LECTURE 5 -***

*If you are finished with all other lab exercises, you can get started on the exercises below.*

### Exercise 4: An interesting regular expressions problem
Create a regular expression which matches all [roman numerals](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Roman-numeral).
You can test your regular expression on [this file](https://mitt.uib.no/files/3148777/download?download_frd=1)
by using `egrep 'your regex' roman_numerals.txt`.

It's okay if your expression also matches an empty string.

<br>


### Exercise 5: (From next week's slides) Extracting text from HTML <br>
a) Consider refining the script from the
[lecture notes](https://lingkurs.h.uib.no/webroot/index.php?page=scripting/htmlcorpus&lang=en&course=ling123)
further by conflating inflections, e.g. *virus* and *viruset*.
Identify challenges for various cases. What extra information would you ideally need? <br>

b) Do a new search in the [Norwegian Newspaper Corpus](http://avis.uib.no/).
Extract words and create a frequency list.
