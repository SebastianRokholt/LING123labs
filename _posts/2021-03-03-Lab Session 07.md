#### Welcome to Lab Session 7:  An Introduction to Python <br>

For this lab session we'll get started with the Python programming language. <br>

Let me know if you need help with any of exercises! I can also help explain concepts from the lecture if there was
anything you found particularly challenging. <br>

Additionally, don't forget that you can
discuss the exercises with your fellow classmates on [MittUiB](https://mitt.uib.no/courses/27100/discussion_topics),
the UiB Studyfellowship [Discord server](https://discord.gg/sXgmWQ2G) (channel: #ling123) or right here in
ling123labs.com's [comments section](#post-extend-wrapper).


The **lecture notes** for lecture 7 can be found
[here](https://lingkurs.h.uib.no/webroot/index.php?page=python&lang=en&course=ling123).

### Exercise 1: Getting started with Python <br>
a) Install the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/) on your machine, if you don't have it already.
On current versions of MacOS, `python3` and `pip3` are already installed. <br>

b) Read the [Python introduction](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_intro.asp) at W3Schools. <br>

<br>


### Exercise 2: Some Python data types<br>
Look at the examples from the
[lecture notes](https://lingkurs.h.uib.no/webroot/index.php?page=python/python-data&lang=en&course=ling123). <br>
a) Write an expression that uses `fruits` and returns 'apricot'. <br>

b) Add another key and value to the dict `movies`. <br>

c) Write an expression that uses `movies` and returns '`brick`'. <br>

<br>


### Exercise 3: Functions and methods

a) Define and test your own function. <br>

<br>


### Exercise 4: Regular expressions and case folding in Python
a) Write an expression that removes vowels `[aeiouy]` from a string. <br>

b) write an expression that removes vowels only at the end of the string.<br>

c) Apply the method `upper()` to a string. Also apply the method `split()` to split the string at whitespace.<br>

<br>


### Exercise 5: List comprehensions
a) Using the output of the above list comprehension, use the `len` function to count the vowels in the sentence.

<br>

### Exercise 6: Ranges and Slices
a) Double the elements of a slice of a range from -5 to 5, starting at 7 and ending at 2, going backward by 1.
The result should be `[4, 2, 0, -2, -4]`.

<br>



### Exercise 7: Palindromes with Python
a) Try the program that prints the palindromes from a test file containing some lines that are palindromes
and some lines that aren't. <br>

b) Define a function `palindromes` that takes the name of a file as an argument and prints the lines in that file
which are palindromes.<br>

c) The above only selects strict palindromes. Make a version which disregards non-alphanumeric characters.
Do this by filtering out all non-alphanumerical characters before the comparison.
Also disregard case differences with the `casefold` method.<br>

*** ADDITIONAL EXERCISES ***

*These questions are a little harder. See if you can figure them out!*

### Exercise 8: IP address formatting
Write a Python program to remove leading zeros from an IP address. <br>
This is an IP address: `216.08.094.196`. We want it to look like this: `216.8.94.196 `

<br>


### Exercise 9: Extracting numbers
Write a Python program to separate and print the numbers of a given string. <br>
If the string is: `"Ten 10 Twenty 20 Thirty 30"`, then the output of the program should be:
```
10
20
30
```
