#### Welcome to Lab Session 8:  Python, Part 2 <br>

For this lab session we'll continue with Python programming. <br>

Let me know if you need help with any of exercises! I can also help explain concepts from the lecture if there was
anything you found particularly challenging. <br>

Additionally, don't forget that you can discuss the exercises with your fellow classmates on
[MittUiB](https://mitt.uib.no/courses/27100/discussion_topics),
the UiB Studyfellowship [Discord server](https://discord.gg/sXgmWQ2G) (channel: #ling123) or right here in
ling123labs.com's [comments section](#post-extend-wrapper).


The **lecture notes** for lecture 8 can be found
[here](https://lingkurs.h.uib.no/webroot/index.php?page=python/zip&lang=en&course=ling123).

### Exercise 1: Tokenizer with RE in Python <br>
Take a look at the example in the
[lecture notes](https://lingkurs.h.uib.no/webroot/index.php?page=python/tokenize&lang=en&course=ling123). <br>
a) What are two important differences between the results of `tokenize` and `word_tokenize`? <br>
b) What if we want to use word_tokenize but also want casefolding? <br>
<br>


### Exercise 2: Zippers <br>
What happens if you try to take the `next` of a zip generator that is exhausted? <br>
<br>


### Exercise 3: N-grams with Python <br>
a) Once again, there is a difference between the results, due to a difference between `tokenize` and `word_tokenize`.
Why would you use one or the other? <br>

b) The resulting n-grams are in both cases generators. If you do not convert them to lists, you can use `next`. <br>

c) Look at the following. Use such a method to convert the list of n-gram tuples to a list of strings in which the
words are separated by spaces. <br>
```Python
>>> [" ".join(('alpha', 'beta', 'gamma'))]
['alpha beta gamma']
```

<br>

<br>

### Exercise 4: NLTK Stopwords
Create a function that removes stopwords from a given text. <br>
> Tip:
> ```python
> from nltk.corpus import stopwords
> stoplist = stopwords.words('english')
> ```



### Exercise 5: Matplotlib basics
Use the `matplotlib` and `pandas` libraries to draw a line chart of Bitcoin price data from `bitcoin-prices.csv`:

```text

Mar-06-2021,48899.23,49147.22,47257.53,48912.38
Mar-05-2021,48527.03,49396.43,46542.51,48927.30

Mar-03-2021,48415.81,52535.14,48274.32,50538.24
Mar-02-2021,49612.11,50127.51,47228.85,48378.99
Mar-01-2021,45159.50,49784.02,45115.09,49631.24
```

> Tip:
> You can use `pandas.read_csv('bitcoin-prices.csv', parse_dates=True, index_col=0)` to read the data from the .csv file.

The output should look something like this:
![A line chart of Bitcoin price data](/assets/img/lab-post-08/ex-08-output.png){: .normal}
_A line chart of Bitcoin price data, created using Matplotlib and Pandas_
<br>
Feel free to play around with the Matplotlib library. For example, you can experiment with the parameters
`color`, `linestyle`, `linewidth`, `marker` and `markersize` to customize the graph.
> Tip: If you have 4 line charts on a single plot, you need to set `color` to a list of four
> [matplotlib colors](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/gallery/color/named_colors.html).

You can also check out the `matplotlib` documentation in its entirety [here](https://matplotlib.org/)!
