#### Welcome to Lab Session 9:  Python, Part 3 <br>
Today, we're going to work with frequency lists, dictionaries and some simple plotting with the `matplotlib` library.
Let me know if you need help with any of the exercises. I can also help explain concepts from the
lectures if you need it. <br>

Don't forget that you can discuss the exercises with your fellow classmates on
[MittUiB](https://mitt.uib.no/courses/27100/discussion_topics),
the UiB Studyfellowship [Discord server](https://discord.gg/sXgmWQ2G) (channel: #ling123) or right here in
ling123labs.com's [comments section](#post-extend-wrapper).


The **lecture notes** for lecture 9 can be found
[here](https://lingkurs.h.uib.no/webroot/index.php?page=python/charfreqpy&lang=en&course=ling123).

### Exercise 1: Character frequencies with Python <br>
Compare the
[Python implementation](https://lingkurs.h.uib.no/webroot/index.php?page=python/charfreqpy&lang=en&course=ling123)
of calculating character frequencies to the Awk implementation. What is simpler and what is more complicated? <br>
<br>
For reference, here is an example of a shell scripting implementation of counting character frequencies with AWK:
```shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash
awk '
  BEGIN { FS="" }

  { for (field=1; field <= NF; field++) {
  freq[$field]++ }
  }

  END { for (char in freq)
        { print freq[char], char } }' | sort -nr
```
<br>


### Exercise 2: Using the Counter module <br>
a) Write a function that takes a filename as an argument and prints the character frequencies as
showed in the [lecture notes](https://lingkurs.h.uib.no/webroot/index.php?page=python/charcounter&lang=en&course=ling123)
on using the Counter module. <br>

b) Reverse the left-to-right order in which the character and frequency are printed. <br>

c) Print the character and its frequency only if the character is alphanumeric. Use the
[`isalnum()` method](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_isalnum.asp) to check if a word is alphanumeric. <br>

<br>

### Exercise 3: Plotting frequencies <br>
a) Recreate the plot from the
[lecture notes](https://lingkurs.h.uib.no/webroot/index.php?page=python/freqplot&lang=en&course=ling123).
Save the plot in a file. <br>

b) Create a new function that takes a filename as argument and plots the character frequencies. <br>
<br>


### Exercise 4: Sorting dictionaries
Create a function that sorts a dictionary by value (as opposed to the keys). In addition to the input dictionary,
the function should have a parameter `reverse` which is set to `False` by default. If the `reverse` parameter is `False`,
the function should sort the dictionary in descending order. Otherwise, the function should sort the dictionary
in ascending order.

> Tip: You can use the built-in function `sorted()` to sort the dictionary. `sorted` has three useful parameters: `iterable`
> (the thing you want to sort), `key` (what to sort by) and `reverse` (a boolean value).

<br>


### Exercise 5: Word frequencies in Python <br>
a) Use the `Counter` module to implement word frequencies in a different way, as demonstrated in the
[chapter on character frequencies](https://lingkurs.h.uib.no/webroot/index.php?page=python/charfreqpy&lang=en&course=ling123).
Sort by frequency or alphabetically. <br>
<br>

b) Given a counter with word frequencies, print out the vocabulary, i.e. all word types, alphabetically sorted,
one word per line. <br>
<br>

c) Compute the word frequencies for a slightly larger text and make a plot.<br>
<br>


### Exercise 6: Summing dictionaries <br>
Write a Python program to sum all the values in a dictionary. <br>
<br>


### Exercise 7: Dictionary-based functions <br>
Create a function `dict_top_3` which takes a dictionary as input, and returns the 3 highest values.
