Then we're going to start with some XML processing using XSLT. <br>

> PS: No labs will be held during the Easter, i.e week 13.

## Part 1: Wrapping up Python with a note on recursion

In order to understand the lecture notes on the
[Levenshtein function](https://lingkurs.h.uib.no/webroot/index.php?page=python/levenshtein&lang=en&course=ling123)
we first need to understand **recursion**, which is an important concept in computer programming. <br>

Recursion is the process in which a function **calls itself**. That may sound confusing, but it's not that hard to grasp
once you see it in action. Let me give you an example.

If you've done any high school or college-level mathematics, you've probably heard of the *factorial*.
A factorial $$n!$$ is the product (the sum of multiplicating) all positive integers less than or equal to $$n$$.
For example, the factorial $$5!$$ is equal to $$5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120$$. The factorial of 1 is 1. <br>

You may have noticed that $$5! = 5 * 4!$$,  and that $$4! = 4 * 3!$$, and so on until you get to $$1!$$ which is just 1.
The formula for calculating a factorial can therefore be stated as:

$$n! = n * (n - 1)!$$

Here, the factorial `n!` is defined *by itself*, which means that this formula uses recursion.
However, the formula doesn't really make sense unless we know that
$$1! = 1$$, or else it would just continue into the negatives and go on forever. <br>

We can define our own factorial function recursively in Python like this:

```python
def factorial_recursive(n):
    if n == 1:  # base case
        return 1

    else:   # recursive case
        return n * factorial_recursive(n - 1)


print(factorial_recursive(5))
```

Executing the code above will output `120`, which is the correct answer for $$5!$$.
It's important to understand that when we call `factorial(n)` we will first have to run `factorial(n - 1)`
before being able to return `n * factorial_recursive(n - 1)`. This applies for all numbers, except for 1, which is the
**base case** (A.K.A the "terminating condition"). `factorial_recursive(5)` will therefore have to wait for
`factorial_recursive(4)` to finish before outputting the answer. Each time a recursive call results in an additional
function call, the first function will have to wait for the "newest" function to finish executing in order to know what
to return. The structure of how older recursive function calls have to wait for the newer function calls to finish
executing is often referred to the "call stack". A stack is a data structure in programming, but
it is intuitively the same as a stack of books. If you want to access the bottom book, you need to remove the books
on top first. Here's a visualization of the stack for our factorial function. Notice how each function call (except for
the last one) has to wait before knowing what to return.

Okay, so I hope that recursion makes a little more sense to you. You can always look up many more examples online,
like [this one](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recursion/) or
[this one](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-is-recursion-in-programming). Now, let's move on to the Levenshtein function
from the lecture notes:

```python
def levenshtein_dist(string, target):
    if not string:
        return len(target)
    if not target:
        return len(string)

    if string[0] == target[0]:
        return levenshtein_dist(string[1:], target[1:])

    lins = levenshtein_dist(string, target[1:]) + 1
    lsub = levenshtein_dist(string[1:], target[1:]) + 1
    ldel = levenshtein_dist(string[1:], target) + 1

    return min(lins, lsub, ldel)


print(levenshtein_dist("fine", "fined"))
print(levenshtein_dist("aloud", "allowed"))
```

The program above lets us know that the [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance)
between the words "fine" and "fined" is 1, which makes sense because you only need to append a single 'd' into the
last position of the word "fine" to get "fined". On the other hand, the
Levenshtein distance between "aloud" and "allowed" is three, because there are three steps needed to transform
"aloud" to "allowed":
  1. insert a second "l" between the "l" and the "o": `alloud`
  2. replace the "u" in the second to last index with a "w": `allowd`
  3. Insert an "e" between the "w" and the "d": `allowed`

So how does the code work? Well, it loops over the input string recursively and compares different parts of the input
string to different parts of the target string to find out whether it would be easiest to insert,
substitute or delete a character in order to get closer to the target string.
Let's go through the code and see what is going on. We'll start with the **base case**:

```python
def levenshtein_dist(string, target):
    # Recursion terminating conditions
    if not string:
        return len(target)
    if not target:
        return len(string)
```

There are two terminating conditions in the base case:
  1. `if not string` says that if the input string is empty, then the Levenshtein distance between the input string and
     the target string is simply the length of the target string.
  2. `if not target` is the same as `if not string`, only for an empty target string instead. The number of insertions needed
     to match an empty string is always equal to the length of the non-empty string. <br>

Then there's the recursive case, which has two parts. The first part states that if the initial character of both strings
are the same, we can move right along and check the rest of the string.

```python
    if string[0] == target[0]:
        return levenshtein_dist(string[1:], target[1:])
```

In other words, if we run
`levenshtein_dist("pie", "pier")`, this part of the code will be executed exactly three times, as there are three
characters in the same position in both words. <br>

Finally, there's the part where the function keeps track of the "cost" of the different operations to calculate
the Levenshtein distance. This is more similar to the example of the recursive factorial function at the beginning,
except that we're only adding numbers together instead of multiplying.

```python
    lins = levenshtein_dist(string, target[1:]) + 1
    lsub = levenshtein_dist(string[1:], target[1:]) + 1
    ldel = levenshtein_dist(string[1:], target) + 1

    return min(lins, lsub, ldel)
```

It is important to note that while the function always returns the minimum value of the cost for insertion,
deletion and substitution, when we check multiple characters in a row we can still use different operations in succession.
The point is that in the end, we'll have a series of numbers (only 1's in this case) we need to add together.
The sum we have at the end is the final output to the terminal. <br>

If you find this hard to understand, don't worry. Everyone struggles with recursion the first time they learn about it.
Let me know if there's anything in particular you don't understand! And remember, the important part about recursion
is figuring out what the *base case*/*terminating condition* is. If a recursive function doesn't have a terminating
condition, well... It'll just run forever! (or at least until the Python maximum recursion depth limit is exceeded).

### Exercise 1.1: Minimum edit distance (Levenshtein) <br>
The Levenshtein function uses the same cost of 1 for all edits. One could argue that a substitution is a combination of a
deletion and an insertion, so it should be more costly.
Change the program so that a substitution has a cost of 2, and test for different strings.
<br>
<br>


### Exercise 1.2: Recursive functions <br>
a) Write a Python function that recursively reverses an input string. <br>
b) Create a function that recursively counts the number of vowels in a string. <br>
